[Micropel](http://www.micropel.cz/) is a producer of PLCs (Programmable Logic Controllers) witch use proprietary protocol for communication with outside world.  The integration adheres strictly to the vendor's specification. 
- [EPNP protocol specification](http://www.micropel.cz/images/stories/Dokumenty/EPNP.pdf)
- [Simple EPNP protocol specification](http://www.micropel.cz/images/stories/Dokumenty/simple_epnp_pub_1_4.pdf)

This integration supports all Micropel devices and TCP/IP HUBs like CA4, CA5 and PLCs with Ethernet connector.

# Calculation of entity addresses and bit masks
Each device stores variables on different addresses in PLC memory RAM. You can find below how to transform I/O pin, fixed variable and Simple variable to proper address and mask.

Note: Mask is use only for binary variables (true / false)

## MPC300 devices

### WORD variables
Formula:
- address = starting_address + (index_of_variable * 2)

**I variables (I0-I31):**
- starting_address = 0x0
- Example: I17 address = 0x0 + (17*2) = 0x22

**O variables (O0-O31):**
- starting_address = 0x40
- Example: O17 address = 0x40 + (17*2) = 0x62

**D variables (D0-D63):**
- starting_address = 0x80
- Example: D34 address = 0x80 + (34*2) = 0xC4

**W variables (W0-W127)**
- starting_address = 0x100
- Example: W17 address = 0x100 + (17*2) = 0x122

### BIT (boolean) variables
Formulas:
- address = starting_address + int(index_of_variable/8)
- bit_index = index_of_variable % 8

**X bits (X0-X31)**
- starting_address = 0x200
- Example: X17 
  - address = 0x200 + int(17/8) = 0x200 + int(2.125) = 0x200 + 2 = 0x202
  - bit_index = 17 % 8 = 1

**Y bits (Y0-Y31)**
- starting_address = 0x204
- Example: Y17
  - address = 0x204 + int(17/8) = 0x204 + int(2.125) = 0x204 + 2 = 0x202 
  - bit_index = 17 % 8 = 1

**M bits (M0-M127)**
- starting_address = 0x0208
- Example: M77
  - address = 0x0208 + int(77/8) = 0x0208 + int(9.625) = 0x0208 + 9 = 0x211
  - bit_index = 77 % 8 = 5

**B bits (B0-B127)**
- starting_address = 0x218
- Example: B17
  - address = 0x218 + int(17/8) = 0x218 + int(2.125) = 0x218 + 2 = 0x202
  - bit_index = 17 % 8 = 1

### Fixed variables and bits in RAM
Formulas:
- address = 0x8010 + fixed_address_of_variable
- bit_index = 0  (constant)

Example: Variable from PLC RAM at address 0x549 
   - address = 0x8010 + 0x549 = 0x8559

## MPC400 devices
### WORD variables
Formula:
- address = starting_address + (index_of_variable * 2)

**D variables (D0-D63):**
- starting_address = 0x80
- Example: D34 address = 0x80 + (34*2) = 0xC4

### BIT (boolean) variables
Formulas:
- address = starting_address + int(index_of_variable/8)
- bit_index = index_of_variable % 8

**M bits (M0-M127)**
- starting_address = 0x0208
- Example: M77
  - address = 0x0208 + int(77/8) = 0x0208 + int(9.625) = 0x0208 + 9 = 0x211
  - bit_index = 77 % 8 = 5

### Fixed variables and bits in RAM
Formulas:
- address = 0x8010 + fixed_address_of_variable
- bit_index = 0  (constant)

Example: Variable from PLC RAM at address 0x549 
   - address = 0x8010 + 0x549 = 0x8559

# Configuring Micropel

First, you define how to communicate with your Micropel network (PESNET) and after that you define the information being exchanged. The Micropel integration allows you to use multiple connections.

## Configuring Micropel common parameters (communication)

Part of the configuration is common for all types of communication. Add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
micropel:
  tcp:
    type: MPC300
    host: 192.168.2.2
    port: 10001
    password: 0
```
{% configuration %}
type:
  description: Type of communication. All communication types use TCP/IP. Possible values are `MPC300` Older generation of PLC and communicators. Use this type for MPC300 PLC and CA4 communicator. `MPC400` New generation of devices. Use this type for MPC400 PLC and CA5 communicator.
  required: true
  type: string
host:
  description: The IP address of your Micropel PLC or CA4/CA5 device, e.g., `192.168.1.1`.
  required: true
  type: string
port:
  description: The network port for the communication.
  required: true
  type: integer
password:
  description: Password for encryption of communication. This password is set in Micropel configuration tools. Value "0" means no encryption and it is the default value by the vendor.
  required: true
  type: string
{% endconfiguration %}

# Configure Micropel platforms

Micropel platform entities are configured next to the HUB configuration.

## Configuring platform sensor

To use your Micropel sensors in your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry

## Opening an issue

When opening an issue, please add your current configuration (or a scaled down version), with at least:

 - the Micropel configuration lines
 - the entity (sensor, etc.) lines

In order for the developers better to identify the problem, please add the
following lines to configuration.yaml:

```yaml
logger:
  logs:
    homeassistant.components.micropel: debug
    pymicropel.client: debug
```

and restart Home Assistant, reproduce the problem, and include the log in the issue.
